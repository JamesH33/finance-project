Project I did in CS50x 2020

I wrote all the code, but the design and functionality were set by the CS50x staff. It used Bootstrap for the bulk of the styling.

The function was to make a mock stock trading application. It used IEX's API to lookup ticker names, current price, etc, then would store the user's "portfolio" and value.
